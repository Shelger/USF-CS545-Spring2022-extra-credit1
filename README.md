Two medium tasks
Leetcode 15: 3Sum
  The core of this task is to use 2 pointers, but it needs sorting the array first.
  Here I used merge sort. The problems I met is that I return integer arrays too many times, as I can make most of them void.

Leetcode 147: Insertion sort of linked list
  This task ask me to take out the current node and insert it into the right position.
  I was confused by how to get the previous with a singly linkedlist. I choose to use an array as a hashmap to store the whole linkedlist.
  The most tough part of this task is the null pointers. I use several conditions to get rid of it.
